<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
  While smartphone usage is exploding, more and more service providers like e-commerce sites are pushing hard 
  to use their mobile apps. Often these apps ask for way too many permissions, "<em>to serve you better</em>".
  We've even seen gimmicks like companies moving over to app only from PC, and then back!
</p>

<p>
  This site aims to note down a <strong>NoApp Manifesto</strong> to help our smartphones.
</p>

<h3>Acceptable Capabilities for a qualifying app</h3>
<ul>
  <li>App absolutely need to scan audio, video etc., <em>while you could ask your customer to take a photo and then upload from gallery, this may be too confusing.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>No no stuff</h3>
<h4>aka,things that websites ensure!</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Auto start. <em>I already have enough notifications in my life; and battery is precious. If I want to use app, I will open it!</em></li>
  <li>Read contacts. <em>Er, my friends aren't your friends!</em></li>
  <li>Read SMS. <em>Evesdropping is unethical!</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Usable mobile site as an app</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add a nice desktop shortcut icon. If needed, prompt user to add to desktop on first use.</li>
  <li>Offline data storage; it is there in HTML specs.</li>
  <li>Layout; responsive design can be solved in many ways.</li>
  <li>Browser compatibility; keep aside Windows Phone, and you just need to solve for WebKit engine.</li>
  <li>Rich UI interaction paradigm; (a) choose simple paradigm (b) if still not satisfied, plenty of CSS and JS tricks.</li>
</ul>
